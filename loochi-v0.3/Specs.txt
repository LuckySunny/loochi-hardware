Designing Loochi v0.3
=====================

So I am starting work on the next prototype and here are the main characteristics I am going to focus on.

Characteristics:

 * Works for different types of LEDs: 10W to 40W at least, more if possible
 * Wide range of input voltage: min 6v (?) to 20V to drive those LEDs
 * Wifi card on board
 * Wifi configurable (???) <= tbd - sdcard? or better, sound jack!
 * Cheap - cheap - cheap - Should cost less than $60 (including LED) so that we can sell it for 150$

 * The firmware should be easy to upgrade
   -> USB connection with the bootloader (a little complicated)
   -> Custom bootloader that uses the RN171 to download firmware - quite complicated too
   -> Custom bootloader that loads from a SD Card the firmware
